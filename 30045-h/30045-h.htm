<h1><span class="sp1">Planet of Dreams</span></h1>

<h2>By James McKimmey, Jr.</h2>

<p class="hd1">Illustrated by Paul Orban</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was</span> a small world, a tiny
spinning globe, placed in the
universe to weather and age by itself
until the end of things. But because
its air was good and its earth
was fertile, Daniel Loveral had
placed a finger upon a map and
said, "This is the planet. This is
the Dream Planet."</p>

<p>That was two years before, back
on Earth. And now Loveral with
his selected flock had shot through
space, to light like chuckling geese
upon the planet, to feel the effect
of their dreams come true.</p>

<p>Loveral was sitting in his office,
drumming his long fingers against
his desk while the name, Atkinson,
ticked through his brain like the
sound of a sewing machine.</p>

<p>Would he be the only one, Loveral
asked himself, or was he just
the first? In either case, it was up
to Loveral, as leader and guiding
hand, to stop this thing and stop
it quickly.</p>

<p>Loveral stood up and put on his
jacket, although there was no need
for it, other than the formality it
gave his figure.</p>

<p>He stepped out of his office into a
clear bright day, where the air was
clean and fresh in his lungs, at
once like frost and fire and sweet
perfume. He walked along a winding
path, which was bordered by
slim-necked flowers and a short
hedge whose even clipped lines
were kept neat by tireless robot
hands.</p>

<p>Trees pointed to a blue sky,
rocking and fluttering their leaves
in a soft breeze, and glinting metallic
houses lay peacefully beyond in
wooded hollows and upon slight
hills.</p>

<p>A whole small world was before
his eyes, set there upon his direction,
maintained by himself with
the help of a dozen complex machines
which lay locked and sealed
in the Maintenance Room for only
his fingers to touch.</p>

<p>It was a busy life for Loveral, up
at dawn to work until deep night,
keeping his flock happy and free
from spirit-killing labor. But it was
a perfect plan, one which had
been tested and turned in his mind
for years. If he had to work hard
to keep it running smoothly, that
was all right. In fact, he had never
been happier.</p>

<p>Now, however, there was this
business about Atkinson. Loveral
was disturbed about that.</p>

<p>He walked on, over the quiet
path which would lead to the
house where Atkinson and his wife
lived. Loveral smiled, in readiness
for any happy face that might appear
before him, to greet him, to
show with thankful eyes appreciation
for his wonderful world. But
that, too, brought thoughts that
were a bit disturbing.</p>

<p>Lately there had been few such
faces. Most of his flock no longer
seemed to care about walking
along the cultivated paths, or smiling,
or nodding, or touching a leaf
here or a flower there. They preferred,
it appeared, to remain deep
inside their houses, as though they
might have become tired of the
soft perfection of Dream Planet.
As though they might have become
weary of quiet woods and
sweet bird-music or a sky which
was always blue.</p>

<p>Loveral shook his head as he
walked, puzzling out his thoughts.
It was strange, but nothing to
worry about certainly.</p>

<p>Just this business about Atkinson.
That was his only worry.</p>

<p>He came slowly up a hill, the top
of which held a low curving house,
with a silver roof and wide, sweeping
windows. There were yellow
and blue and deep red flowers,
skirting the sides of the house, and
green ivy grew thickly between the
glistening windows. The lawn, dotted
with small leafy trees and
round bushes, sloped down from
the front of the house, looking like
a carefully arranged painting.</p>

<p>Loveral pressed a button beside
a shining door and waited, smiling
through his pale blue kindly eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mrs. Atkinson</span> appeared
after several moments and
stood blinking at him. She was a
thin woman, who seemed to have
gotten even thinner, Loveral noticed.
She was working her fingers
at the neck of her dress. She smiled
but her lips wavered.</p>

<p>"My dear," Loveral greeted her
in his soft voice, showing the
goodness in his eyes.</p>

<p>She nodded her recognition,
opening her mouth without speaking.</p>

<p>"May I?" said Loveral finally,
waving his long fingers toward the
living room.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the woman. "Of
course, Mr. Loveral." And as she
spoke Loveral had the impression
she might suddenly begin crying.</p>

<p>Loveral followed the woman
into the house, noticing all over
again the precise way everything
had been arranged. The rug was
soft beneath his feet, and the light
came in through the windows in
such a way that it, too, became
soft. The furniture, molded to hold
a human body most comfortably,
rested about the room in perfect
efficiency.</p>

<p>"Your place is so lovely," Loveral
said, out of his old habit from
Earth. But his words seemed to
ring strangely in the quiet, because
it was his own arrangement, like
all the other rooms on the planet.
And Mrs. Atkinson, standing thin
and nervous before him, had nothing,
after all, to do with it. The
cleanliness was the work of his robot
machines, the planning his own.
It was like complimenting himself.</p>

<p>He cleared his throat and stood,
smiling his most benevolent smile
to reassure Mrs. Atkinson.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear. Is George about?"</p>

<p>Again, the woman's hand skittered
to her throat.</p>

<p>"He's not ill, surely?" Loveral
asked, although this, too, was silly,
because foods, selected and prepared
for utmost nutrition, packed
and frozen to be doled out in weekly
quantities, purified air, disease-killing
serums, simply written folders
on exercise, and of course Loveral's
own philosophies of quiet,
peaceful living&mdash;all of this guarded
well the health of Dream Planet's
flock.</p>

<p>The woman shook her head.
"No, George is fine. He's just&mdash;sleeping,
I think."</p>

<p>"Rest is nature's finest tonic,"
said Loveral, and hearing his voice
thought suddenly there was hardly
anything he could say any more
that might not sound a bit out of
place in this peaceful world. Rest
to the man who had nothing to do
ceased to be a tonic.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Loveral. "May
we just sit down, my dear?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Atkinson jerked a hand toward
one of the chairs and then
wound her fingers.</p>

<p>Loveral sat down and leaned
back, smiling his most charming
smile. "Perhaps George might
awaken after a bit?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," the woman said, her
eyes flickering, and she sat upon
the edge of one chair, like a bird
perched upon a thin wire.</p>

<p>Loveral waited, legs crossed,
leaning his head back against the
silken softness of the chair. It was
so good to relax these days. The
business of watching and of caring
for his flock was trying. When you
have brought an entire community
of people at great expense through
space, guaranteeing to give them a
life of constant comfort and ease,
so that they might dream and think
as they wander through the flowers
and the leaves, their thoughts
cleansed of worry about work and
responsibility, then you have a job.
Loveral was most busy, busier than
his heritage of wealth ever before
had allowed, seeing to all of this.</p>

<p>But he also was most content&mdash;with
everything except Atkinson.</p>

<p>Mrs. Atkinson teetered on the
edge of her chair, as though she
might at any moment go flying
across the room in a crazy gyration.
There was something about her
eyes, Loveral noticed, while he
peacefully nodded in the chair.
Fear, perhaps.</p>

<p>If so, he probably had been
right. He tightened himself, listening.
There it was again. The sound.
Just as he had heard it a day before
when he had passed near the
house. He leaned forward quickly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Atkinson jumped.</p>

<p>Loveral smiled. "Didn't I hear a
noise of some sort, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Noise?" the woman said, as
though her own voice were the
sound of an echo.</p>

<p>"An odd noise," Loveral said,
his eyes searching.</p>

<p>The woman's hands fluttered
about her dress.</p>

<p>Loveral stood up. "Would you
mind if I just glanced about, my
dear?"</p>

<p>The woman didn't answer, but
Loveral was already moving across
the room toward a door. He
opened it and walked down a hall.
The noise grew stronger. He threw
open another door.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He stood</span> watching while
George Atkinson spun
around, dark eyes flashing, hair
tousled. There was a two days'
growth of beard darkening Atkinson's
face.</p>

<p>"Why, George," Loveral said,
swiftly examining the litter of metal
and wood which was spread
over a table behind Atkinson.
There was a home-made hammer
in Atkinson's hand. "What have
we here, George?"</p>

<p>"Something for you," Atkinson
said, tightening his fingers about
the handle of the hammer.</p>

<p>Loveral grinned his famous Loveral
grin. "That's fine. What could
it be?"</p>

<p>"None of your damned business."</p>

<p>"<i>George</i>," Loveral said, his smile
still white but his eyes narrow
and quick.</p>

<p>The woman was behind them.
Her voice screeched. "George, I
told you. Why didn't you listen,
George? You should have listened
to me. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>Loveral held up a hand, still
watching Atkinson. "Now tell me,
George, what is it you're making
for me?"</p>

<p>Atkinson raised the hammer
slightly.</p>

<p>Loveral stood very still. "That's
a nice hammer, George."</p>

<p>Atkinson's eyes were black beneath
his thick brows.</p>

<p>"You made that, didn't you?"
Loveral asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I made that," Atkinson
said. "I made that and I made
something else. Another minute and
I'll have that finished, too."</p>

<p>"George," said Loveral, stepping
quietly forward, "I don't like to say
this, of course. You've been one of
our very best members. But nobody
works here, George. We can't allow
that. You know the rules."</p>

<p>"I know the rules, all right."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Loveral said, extending
his hand toward the hammer,
"we'll just destroy this and
whatever else you might have been
making. We'll just forget it ever
happened. We'll get along real fine
that way, George. We'll just be
such good friends."</p>

<p>"We'll just go to hell," said Atkinson,
snatching his hammer
away.</p>

<p>Loveral's smile disappeared. "I'll
tell you, George. I have to mean
business with this. You know the
reasons. If we allow anybody to
work here, then there's going to be
trouble. That isn't our plan. We're
here to grow within ourselves and
expand culturally. Not to commercialize
a beautiful world like Dream
Planet."</p>

<p>Atkinson stood unmoving, and
Loveral could see the way the
man's muscles were tight, like steel
springs, and the way his eyes
burned deep inside their blackness.</p>

<p>"We've given you everything you
need," Loveral explained, trying to
adjust the smile on his lips again.
"Everybody has everything they
want. But, you see, if you sit there
and work and make something that
someone else doesn't have, then the
whole system is destroyed. Then
someone will want what you've
made. We'll have jealousy and
hatred and fighting. This is the
stuff of which wars are made,
George. You know that. It starts
with small things like this, but it
grows. When it does, the structure
of our life here will collapse. You
wouldn't want that, would you,
George?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Atkinson said, his mouth
white at the edges. "I'd like to see
the whole rotten thing collapsed
and blown to hell!"</p>

<p>Loveral's teeth snapped together
and his lips grew tight. He could
feel a muscle jumping along his
neck.</p>

<p>Atkinson looked at him with furious
eyes. "What do you think it's
like, living this way? You're busy
working twenty-four hours a day,
while we wander around this
damned prison like the breathing
dead. You can feel sweat and aches
in your bones from a hard day's
work. Sleep is like medicine to you,
instead of another stretch of torture.
You can forget your own
brain for a while by doing something
with your hands. You can relax
because you can get tired. Not
us, by God. Not us!"</p>

<p>"I envy you, George," Loveral
said through his teeth.</p>

<p>"Oh, like hell you do. You treat
us like we were helpless infants.
You feed and clothe us and do all
our work, and you're so happy you
damned near split your guts."</p>

<p>"I'll take that, if you don't
mind," Loveral said, reaching for
the hammer, his voice suddenly icy
cold.</p>

<p>Atkinson slammed back against
the table. "No, you won't. You won't
take anything more at all. You've
taken our spirit and our pride and
the strength right out of our spines.
You won't take anything more!"</p>

<p>"George?" Loveral said, but not
moving any further.</p>

<p>Atkinson slid the hammer back
of him onto the table, and his hands
were searching among a dozen scattered
pieces of metal and wood. He
watched Loveral as he worked.
"Let me show you what else I've
made," he said.</p>

<p>"I'd hate to do it," Loveral said,
"but I can stop your food, your
water, everything."</p>

<p>Atkinson's hands moved swiftly,
assembling the pieces. He nodded.
"You can, but you won't."</p>

<p>"I have the only keys to the storage
units. I control everything,
George."</p>

<p>"Correction," said Atkinson,
holding an assembled revolver in
his hands. "You <i>did</i>."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Loveral</span> looked at what Atkinson
had in his hands. He
blinked.</p>

<p>"You're nearly dead," Atkinson
said.</p>

<p>Loveral looked at Atkinson, into
his eyes. "If you wanted to kill me,
you could have done it some other
way."</p>

<p>Atkinson shook his head. "Just
this way. Just with something that
took me dozens of days and nights
to make. With something that made
me sweat and swear to get. It was
difficult&mdash;with no tools or proper
materials&mdash;but that made it all the
better. Now I've got it finished,"
he said, pushing a bullet into the
chamber, "and ready to use."</p>

<p>Loveral stood frozen, then he
turned. "My dear," he said to the
woman who moved her mouth as
though her voice had been pumped
out of her. He reached to touch
her shoulder. She recoiled, as
though his fingers held poison.
"George," he said, turning back to
the black-eyed man.</p>

<p>"This is a great moment," Atkinson
said, lifting the muzzle of
the revolver. "When I squeeze the
trigger, it'll be like blowing the lock
off a prison door. I'll go yelling to
the others, and we'll smash down
the whole goddamned place. We'll
smash it down, so we'll have to rebuild
it. We'll pull apart every
robot you've got. We'll tear apart
the food lockers and have a celebration
for a week, and when we've
gotten sick from too much food,
we'll start growing some more with
our own hands. We'll make forges
for the men and looms for the
women. We'll burn our clothes
and make new ones. We'll grow
corn in the fields. We'll pump water
from the ground. You're finished,
Loveral."</p>

<p>Loveral stared at the revolver.
"George," he said, pleading. "The
plans. The beautiful, beautiful
plans. All of you, you all wanted
peace and contentment. Time to
think and dream. You all wanted
to get away from the work and
the worry and the responsibility.
You&mdash;"</p>

<p>Atkinson fired the gun into Loveral's
stomach.</p>

<p>Loveral gestured at the air and
fell to his knees. Atkinson threw
his gun through a window and
grabbed his wife by the hand.
"Hurry!" he said, laughing. "Hurry!"</p>

<p>Loveral felt of the blood on his
shirt and rested on his knees. He
could hear footsteps, racing through
the house and out to the yard. He
held out his bloody hand and
looked at it. Atkinson's voice pealed
through the warm clear air. "He's
dead! Loveral's dead!"</p>

<p>There was a sound of sudden activity,
and everywhere went the
cry, "Loveral's dead!"</p>

<p>Loveral sank to his haunches and
opened his lips. The blood was
there, too. He could hear the shouts
and the laughter, and then the tearing
of steel, the smashing of glass.
He bent over his knees, trembling
with a sudden chill. The sound of
destruction grew like thunder.
"Why?" he said in his dying throat.
"Oh, why? It was what they said
they wanted."</p>
